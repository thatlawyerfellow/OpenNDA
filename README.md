**OPEN NDA**
Version 0.1

**THE OPEN NDA IS IN BETA. KINDLY DO NOT USE IT TILL IT IS READY. IT IS UP TODAY FOR COMMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS SO WE CAN CLOSE THE DRAFT**

**DESCRIPTION**
OpenNDA is a universal, Creative-Commons-style Non-Disclosure Agreement that applies automatically when the Recipient opens the media containing confidential information. No signatures, no negotiation, no back-and-forth. The Sender affixes the Adequate Notice, the Recipient accesses the content, and the NDA is in force. Simple, portable, and enforceable.
This repository hosts the official text: https://github.com/thatlawyerfellow/OpenNDA/blob/main/v1

**EASY TO USE**

OpenNDA is designed to be the easiest NDA in the world.
You do not need lawyers, signatures, DocuSign, PDFs, or forms.
You simply:
Attach the Adequate Notice.
Send your document, file, email, or media.
The moment the Recipient opens or accesses the content beyond the notice, the NDA applies automatically.

You can attach OpenNDA to:
Email attachments
ZIP files
PDFs
Word documents
Excel sheets
PowerPoint decks
Git repositories
Audio and video files
Code and design previews
Cloud-shared folders
Any medium capable of carrying data
OPEN NDA works anywhere information can be accessed.

**FEATURES**
Automatic Acceptance
The NDA binds the Recipient once they access the material past the notice.
Extremely Simple
Add one short notice. That is all. No negotiation or forms.
Universal
Works across any format or communication channel.
No Signature Required
Acceptance occurs by access, similar to Creative Commons licensing.
Sender–Recipient Neutral
Both parties can define confidentiality, commercialization limits, law, jurisdiction, and term using standard codes.
Modular Code System
Use short tags to specify rules:
C / RC: Confidentiality obligations
B / NB: Business or non-commercial use
L: Governing law
J: Jurisdiction
T: Term in years
This keeps notices compact and machine-readable.
Legally Enforceable
Provides rights to injunctive relief, includes severability, jurisdiction clauses, term rules, and standard definitions.

**HOW IT WORKS**
The Sender attaches the Adequate Notice (example below).
The Recipient opens the file/message/media.
The NDA becomes binding without further action.
Obligations apply for the duration of the Term.

**ADEQUATE NOTICE TEMPLATE**
“The information contained in this medium is subject to the terms of the OPEN NDA. Continuing to access it means you agree to its terms for a period of 3 years from today. You can access a copy of OPEN NDA at: https://github.com/thatlawyerfellow/OpenNDA/blob/main/v1.”

**PLACEMENT RULES**
Documents (PDF/DOC): Put the notice on page 1
Spreadsheets: First sheet named NOTICE
Slides: First slide before any content
Videos: Display notice for first 10 seconds
Audio: Read notice in first 10 seconds
Emails: Paste the notice above the confidential content
Zip/Media Files: Include a NOTICE.txt at the top level
Any other medium: Include the notice wherever possible and include a copy of the NDA if technically feasible

**ATTACHING OPENNDA TO EMAIL**
This is one of the most powerful features.
To use OpenNDA in an email, simply paste the notice above the confidential content or place it at the top of the email body describing the attachment. Opening the email or the attachment constitutes acceptance. No downloads or signatures required.
